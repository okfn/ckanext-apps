"""
A CKAN paster command for migrating ckanext-apps database tables to CKAN
'Related Items' database tables.

The fields used by ckanext-apps don't correspond exactly to those used by
CKAN's related items. Fields will be migrated as follows:

- id, title, url created and featured columns from application and idea tables
  are copied to corresponding columns in related table.

- description, developer, developer_url, submitter, license, code_url and
  api_url columns from application and idea tables all go into description
  column of related table.

- name and updated columns from application and idea tables are discarded.

- owner_id column in related table will be empty for every row.

- view_count column in related table will be 0 for every row.

- The application_tag and idea_tag tables from ckanext-apps are ignored because
  CKAN related items do not support tags. All application and idea tags will be
  discarded.

- ckanext-apps stores application images in the PostgreSQL database itself,
  whereas CKAN related items only have an image_url field and do not handle
  hosting the image file.

  The image_url column in the related table will be filled in based on the
  application_id column in the application_image table.
  The images themselves need to be scraped from the site running ckanext-apps
  and hosted at these URLs. This script doesn't handle the scraping, there is
  another script in ckanext-apps for it.

- For related items of type idea the image_url column of the related table
  will be None, ckanext-apps ideas don't have images.
